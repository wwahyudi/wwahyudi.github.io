Just a note, I think this explanation of differences between Patch vs. Hotfix vs. Maintenance Release vs. Service Pack which easy to understand (for me).

### Patch
<span class="bg-dark-gray white">Publicly released update to fix a known bug/issue.</span>

### Hotfix 
<span class="bg-dark-gray white">Update to fix a very specific issue, not always publicly released.</span>

### Maintenance Release
<span class="bg-dark-gray white">Incremental update between service packs or software versions to fix multiple outstanding issues.</span>

### Service Pack
<span class="bg-dark-gray white">Large Update that fixes many outstanding issues, normally includes all Patches, Hotfixes, Maintenance releases that predate the service pack.</span>

		"That being said that isn’t how we do updates at all. We just increment the version and/or build number (which is based on the date) and just call it an “Update”. For most software I find that easier, you can easily see that one computer is running 1.1.50 vs 1.2.25 and know which is newer."
