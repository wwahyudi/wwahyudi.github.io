Hi there!

Thank you for passing by to this blog. First, sorry that I may make many mistakes on this blog, both on the articles and especially for the English I used here. English is not my mother language. OK, that sound like an excuse. I’m still learning English. 

So, I made this blog because I just want to take note about something I need. Also, I made this blog because I want to learn English. 

Basically this blog post, maybe bit same with [sapikuda.com](http://sapikuda.com), which is my first blog that used Wordpress. I’m trying to move one by one post from there to this blog. 

And one more, thanks for visiting.

I just come with second thought that maybe I will post my personal stuff here too. But maybe on Bahasa (Yes! Bahasa Indonesia).
