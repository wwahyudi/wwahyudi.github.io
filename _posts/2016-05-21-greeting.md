Hi there!

Thank you for passing by this blog. First, sorry that I may make mistakes on this blog, both on the articles and especially on the English I used here. English is not my mother language. OK, that sounds like an excuse.

So, I made this blog because I want to take note of something important for myself. Also, I would like to learn my English better on this blog.

And thanks for visiting.

Oh ya, This blog powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and with theme [Pixyll](https://themes.gohugo.io/pixyll/). Thanks alot guys!

#### Update on August 2016

~~Basically this blog post, maybe bit same with [sapikuda.com](http://sapikuda.com), which is my first blog that used Wordpress. Iâ€™m trying to move one by one post from there to this blog.~~
Yeah, old wordpress posts had been moved to this site.

#### Update 2 on April 2017

I just came with second thought that maybe I will post my stuff here too. But may on Bahasa Indonesia.

#### Another update on April 2021

I made changes to the blog template. I am no longer use Pixyll. I chose [Garth from David Darnes](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth) with slightly modified styles.
