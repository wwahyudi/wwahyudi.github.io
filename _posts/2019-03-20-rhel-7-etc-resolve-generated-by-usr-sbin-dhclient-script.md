For manual configuration on RHEL 7 DNS address on `/etc/resolv.conf`, the configuration always reverts back after reboot because dhclient script controlling it, and it's having label `';generated by /usr/sbin/dhclient-script'` 

![etc resolv.conf is having generated by usr sbin dhclient-script](http://sapikuda.com/images/posts/2019-03-20-rhel-7-etc-resolve-generated-by-usr-sbin-dhclient-script/etc-resolv.conf.png)

To solve this issue, edit file `/etc/dhclient-enter-hooks`
```
vi /etc/dhclient-enter-hooks
```

And append code
```
make_resolv_conf(){
	:
}
```

Save and close the file.
