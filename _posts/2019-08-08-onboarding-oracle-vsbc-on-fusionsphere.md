One of operator in Indonesia require Huawei to help onboarding 3rd party VNF Oracle® Communications Session Border Controller (OCSBC). I assigned to help on the onboading process so the VNF that works as vSBC or Session Border Controller able to run on FusionSphere Openstack.

Oracle® Communications Session Border Controller (OCSBC) applies core session control to reduce the complexity and cost of delivering high-value, revenue generating SIP multimedia services. Oracle Communications Session Border Controller can be used to support a broad range of SIP services including residential or business voice, GSMA-defined Rich Communication Suite (RCS) services and fixed mobile convergence (FMC) for small subscriber populations or initial service rollouts.

Oracle Communications Session Router (OCSR) is a next generation session routing proxy that incorporates both IETF SIP proxy and 3GPP Breakout Gateway Control Functions (BGCF). It is specifically designed to control the routing of large volumes of SIP session signaling messages. Session Router provides high-performance SIP routing with scalable routing policies that increase overall network capacity and reduce costs. It plays a central role in Oracle's open session routing (OSR) architecture and helps service providers build a scalable, next-generation signaling core for SIP-based services.

Both the Oracle Communications Session Border Controller (OCSBC) and Oracle Session Router (OCSR) are capable of being deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Support for the OCSBC and OCSR as VNFs is the same. This document refers to the OCSBC, but the reader can assume that all information herein applies equally to the OCSR.

The process documented on Huawei Support website. Read on [support.huawei.com](https://support.huawei.com/carrier/docview!docview?nid=SKB1100018135).
