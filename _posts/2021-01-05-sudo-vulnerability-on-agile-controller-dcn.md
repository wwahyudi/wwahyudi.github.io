summary:    CVE-2019-14287 sudo Vulnerability Allows Bypass of User Restrictions on Agile Controller-DCN
category:   Huawei
---

Vulnerability check on OS of Agile Controller-DCN V300R019C10 which is EulerOS 2.0 SP8 and the result of that sudo version is 1.8.23.

Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a per-command basis. It is not a replacement for the shell. Features include: the ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a per-host basis, copious logging of each command (providing a clear audit trail of who did what), a configurable timeout of the sudo command, and the ability to use the same configuration file (sudoers) on many different machines.

In Sudo before 1.8.28, an attacker with access to a Runas ALL sudoer account can bypass certain policy blacklists and session PAM modules, and can cause incorrect logging, by invoking sudo with a crafted user ID. For example, this allows bypass of !root configuration, and USER= logging, for a `sudo -u \#$((0xffffffff))` command.
