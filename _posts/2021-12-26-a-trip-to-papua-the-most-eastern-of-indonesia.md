I went to Sorong, Papua Barat, for a business trip to help install security devices on the [BAKTI USO project](https://kominfo.go.id/content/detail/32966/siaran-pers-no-62hmkominfo022021-tentang-lima-paket-kontrak-payung-percepat-pemerataan-bts-4g-di-wilayah-3t/0/siaran_pers). Also, I gave training to the partner engineers to install the security devices.

It was pretty challenging to be there. Since I need to go on-site on several sites quite far, the places also have no electricity and have no phone signal.

I went to several places in Sorong districts, like Klamono, Klaso, and Segun. Also, I went to Tambraw like Mega, Sauspor, Werur Besar, and Fef. Not to mention, I went to Raja Ampat and Sorong Selatan.

The first place I was visited was Mega. Mega is a small town in Moraid, Tambrauw Regency of West Papua, Indonesia. The town is located on the northwestern coast of the Bird's Head Peninsula. I stayed in our driver's home who live there. It was a nice place with a "private beach," no one visited the beach. Mega has the most admirable sunrise view. No one on the beach. For several days, it was my private beach, with no tourists except myself. The seawater is also super clean. Fishes and other sea creatures easily to see.

Next, I visited Asbaken. Asbaken is located in Makbon, and it was a pretty unique place to stay. It is a bit tough to reach Asbaken. We need to climb up to 870 above sea level then descend to 5 above sea level on a short 1 km concrete road. It is situated on 2 big cliffs with super-rich fishes and sea creatures. People say that we should not use any net to fish and use fishing rods instead.

One day on the weekend, I went to Raja Ampat, the most famous tourist spot in Papua. A friend of mine helped me book the one-day trip slot. It was the fantastic view I have ever seen.

First, we visit Piaynemo. Piaynemo is one of the most iconic locations of Raja Ampat, along with Wayag Island. The line of karst rocks protruding from the ocean is the main attraction in Raja Ampat. We climbed to the top of the karst rock, and it was pretty hard for a fat man like me, but the view paid me well.

The next destination is Telaga Bintang. Telaga Bintang is a laguna surrounded by coral hills, and when viewed from a height, the shape of the waters is like a star.

We stopped for lunch on Wayag with a stunning view.

We also visited Pasir Timbul in Raja Ampat. Pasir Timbul is a stretch of sand that forms a small island in the middle of the Raja Ampat ocean. Pasir Timbul is very dependent on the ebb and flow of seawater. At high tide, this stretch of the sand island will disappear and sink into the water. In contrast, at low tide, Pasir Timbul will actually appear. Because of its uniqueness that can disappear and arise, this object is called Pasir Timbul.

I also went to Sorong Selatan. Sorong Selatan has the most excellent rivers I have ever seen. The waters are cold and clear. Taking a bath in one river is the most treat I will never reject on unbearable heat.
