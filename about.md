Widya Wahyudi is a foolish person who tried to learn how to write a blog, so he must *go-blog* (red: in Javanese, word '*goblog*' means stupid) on this blog.

Born in Malang, East Java and he grew up there. Unfortunately, the earth was taken over by aliens from Mars, so his parent took him on a small rocket and made him landed on a hot doomed city, Surabaya. He was lost and finally joined the magical school named Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya. Then he started to learn some magic power like PHP, Java, and ~~f**king damn~~ hard spelling magic spell. He also learned about some black magic which make some junky servers to communicate. But he didn't learn much because too much Dota (also Dota2), Skyrim, and mostly he thought about absolutely nothing.

But when he graduated from that magical school, he vanished.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend, legend became myth and for two and a half thousand years, he reappeared. Someone discovered him as a magic caster. And although his magic skills are not even great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But we should believe he can save the world.
